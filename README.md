# Evaluation of deep learning architectures for short-term price forecasting in the Spanish electricity market

In this project, we compare different deep neural network architectures (+XGBoost) on the task of predicting the next hour's electricity price by using the past values of the electricity price as well as those of another features related to energy generation and weather conditions. Furthermore, the project contains a meticulous exploration and cleaning of the data, time series analysis of the electricity price and careful feature engineering. With further research and development (e.g. as a forecasting model which is updated in real-time) this kernel could possibly prove useful to all the stakeholders (electric power companies, investors, etc.) involved in energy markets.

## Usage 

The project is composed from the following files:
- roussis_project_dnn.ipynb: The full code of the project is contained in this single Jupyter notebook. The reason why is that the project was made for a university course and it required all the functionality in a single place.
- roussis_report_dnn.pdf: The report of the project includes a detailed analysis of the case study, the methodology that was followed, the final results of the experiments and the references that were used.
- roussis_presentation_dnn.pdf: This is presentation that was electronically presented to the instructors of the course, as well as the other students who submitted projects.
